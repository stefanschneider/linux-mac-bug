Requirements:
 - Vagrant
 - VirtualBox

Run `vagrant up` to start the 3 linux servers.

Run `/vagrant/server1.sh` from first VitrualBox VM. (user and password is: 'vagrant' and 'vagrant')
Run `/vagrant/server2.sh` from the 2nd VM.
Run `/vagrant/server3.sh` from the 3rd VM.

Server 2 will not be able to communicate with server 1 because it will mark the old MAC address from server 2 as rechable. Server 3 will create TCP connections to server 1 and it this will cause server 1 to mark the old MAC address from server 2 as reachable. If server 3 will stop creating TCP connections, eventually the old MAC will expire.

This behaviour was happening in a large OpenStack deployment.

Note: lucid64 did not have this bug

Workaround:
 - Reduce /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/base_rechable_time_ms to a lower time duration

-- server1

sudo ip link set dev eth1 promisc on

watch -n 0.5 ip -s neigh show

-- server2

sudo ip link set dev eth1 promisc on

nc -w 1 192.168.50.4 22

sudo ip link set dev eth1 address 08:00:22:33:`openssl rand -hex 1`:`openssl rand -hex 1`

sudo ip neigh replace 192.168.50.4 nud permanent dev eth1 lladdr 08:00:27:fb:9e:99
